# Problem Statement

Given a starting position on a phone dial pad, a knight chess piece can move in an "L" shape pattern - two steps horizontally followed 
by one vertically, or one step horizontally then two vertically. Write a program that determines the number of distinct numbers 
that can be dialed on the phone dial pad in N hops from the given starting position.

I sovled this task using dynamic programming, and achived O(N) time and O(1) space complexity
